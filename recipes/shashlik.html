        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shashlik is a Russian word for meat skewers (shish kebobs), marinated and grilled over charcoal, or wood fire. Traditionally, shashlik is made of lamb. However, pork is common alternative nowadays.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium lemon</li>
            <li>2 cups red wine</li>
            <li>1/2 large red onion, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds lamb, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>skewers, as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut lemon in half and juice. Cut 2 rinds into chunks.</li>
            <li>Place lemon juice and rinds into a large glass or ceramic bowl with red wine, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper; mix well. Add lamb and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or up to 18 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove lamb from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Thread lamb on to skewers.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook skewers, turning occasionally, on the preheated grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat reads at least 130 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
