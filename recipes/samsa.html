        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour through the sieve into a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add salt to a cup of warm water and mix until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Combine the water with flour and kneed the dough to form a dough ball. It took 10 minutes in the stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough ball and leave to rest for 30 min.</li>
            <li>Once rested, sprinkle the working surface with a little flour and roll the dough into a thin rectangular sheet approximately 2-3mm or 1/8 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Cover the sheet with melted ghee.</li>
            <li>Starting on one edge, roll the dough tightly like a cigar.</li>
            <li>Cut the roll into 18 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Press each piece with palm of your hand to make a patty.</li>
            <li>Stack patties with parchment paper between them in an airtight container, and place in the fridge to chill for at least 3 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients and mix well. Leave to rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the dough patties out of the fridge and roll each patty out into a thin circle sheet using a rolling pin. Roll on one side only and never flip the dough.</li>
            <li>Divide the filling between each circle evenly.</li>
            <li>Bring two opposite sides together making a triangle. Pinch the corners. Then bring the bottom part and pinch together again.</li>
            <li>Put the samsa on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper seem side down.</li>
            <li>Cover with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using.</li>
            <li>Bake at 385 F for 30 minutes or until golden.</li>
